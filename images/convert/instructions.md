1. Make the script executable

Before you can run the file, macOS needs to know it’s allowed to execute as a program. Open Terminal and use the chmod (change mode) command:
Bash

chmod +x compress_videos.sh

2. Run the script

Once permissions are set, you can run it using one of the following methods:

Method A: Direct Execution (Recommended) Type ./ followed by the filename. The ./ tells the terminal to look in the current directory.
Bash

./compress_videos.sh
